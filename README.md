## Why LabelSync?

While working at Prisma, I discovered that many companies struggle with repository organisation. In particular, companies struggle with managing labels across multiple repositories in their organisation.

My vision is to develop the best in class software that would help companies triage issues and pull requests, and simplify the use of labels.

## Features and Quirks of LabelSync

Label Sync helps you sync Github labels across multiple repositories:

- üõ∞ **Centralised management**: Handle multiple repositories from a central configuration.
- üëÆ **Restricts unconfigured labels**: Prevent adding new labels that don't fit into your workflow.
- üê£ **Aliases**: Quickly rename old labels to a new label.
- üé¢ **Siblings**: Create workflows with labels.
